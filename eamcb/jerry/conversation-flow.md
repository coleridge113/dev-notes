# Goals
Jerry needs to categorize inquiries between inquiries that lead to quotes or just FAQs

Inquiries that lead to quotes will generate ticket numbers whereas FAQ inquiries just need to be answered.

# Determine Inquiry

If a customer inquires about accreditation or shipment, go to `Inquiry leading to quote` section
    otherwise, go to `Inquiry leading to general FAQ`


## Inquiry leading to quote

### Customer is interested in accreditation

### Customer is interested in shipping


## Inquiry leading to general FAQ
